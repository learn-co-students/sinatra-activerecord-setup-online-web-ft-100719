class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]

  def up
    create_table :dogs do |t|

  def down 
    drop_table :dogs

# The change method is actually a shorter way of writing up and down methods. 
# We can refactor our migration to look like this:

# def change
#   create_table :dogs do |t|
#     t.string :name
#     t.string :breed
#   end
# end
